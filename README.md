# DangerNoodle

## Introduction

DangerNoodle is a turn-based 2D Worm-like game where each noodle can shoot against other noodles using various weapons.

## Motivation
DangerNoodle was a university course project designed to teach students how to collaborate with other students in a large codebase.

## Contribution
My team was the main driving force of the game despite being suffered from lower student participation compared to other classes. As such we were able to implement approximately 60-70% of the game.

In particular, I was able to implement:

- Multiplayers/Networking
- Character Statistics
- Mana
- Damage
- Camera
- Minimap
- Buffs & Debuffs
- HUD
- In-game console
